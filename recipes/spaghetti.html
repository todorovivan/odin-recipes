        <h4>Your freshly made lasagna</h4>
        <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. 
            It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>
            <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. 
                What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>
